  Breaks a feature, PRD, or requirement into TDD implementation tasks with task 0.0 as
  feature branch creation (MUST be first), each task uses TDD quadruplet (RED test→run
  fail→GREEN impl→run pass→REFACTOR), includes mandatory public API docs task, update
  docs task, and code review task, output with `Guidance Used` and `Relevant Files`
  sections saved to `tasks/tasks-[name].md`, auto-detects test command/source dir/test
  dir from project conventions. Ruby-first but language-agnostic. Trigger words: tdd task
  list, tdd tasks, generate tasks, tdd breakdown, implementation tasks, task breakdown,
  feature tasks, quadruplet pattern.

# Generate TDD Tasks

## Quick Reference

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Task 0.0** | Always create feature branch first: `git checkout -b feature/<name>` |
| **TDD quadruplet** | Each implementation task has 5 sub-steps: RED test → Run fail → GREEN impl → Run pass → REFACTOR |
| **Auto-detect** | Test command, source directory (`lib/` or `src/`), test directory (`spec/` or `test/`) |
| **Required tasks** | Public API docs, update existing docs, code review — always included |
| **Output path** | `tasks/tasks-<feature-name>.md` |
| **Required sections** | `Guidance Used` and `Relevant Files` at the top |
| **Language** | English unless explicitly requested otherwise |

## HARD-GATE

```text
TASK GENERATION GATES:
1. Feature branch (task 0.0) MUST be the first task in every task list.
2. Every implementation task MUST use the TDD quadruplet pattern (RED → fail → GREEN → pass → REFACTOR).
3. Public API documentation, update existing documentation, and code review tasks are MANDATORY — do not omit them.
4. Guidance Used section MUST explain what conventions/guides/skills drove the breakdown.
5. Relevant Files section MUST list detected source and test directories and key files.
6. Output MUST be saved to tasks/tasks-<feature-name>.md unless user specifies otherwise.
```

## Core Process

### Step 1: Project Detection

Detect and list the project's conventions before generating tasks:

1. **Test command** — Check config files. Ruby: `bundle exec rspec` if `Gemfile` has `rspec`. Python: `pytest`. JS/TS: `npm test` / `yarn test`. Rust: `cargo test`. Go: `go test ./...`.
2. **Source directory** — `lib/` (Ruby), `src/` (most other languages).
3. **Test directory** — `spec/` (RSpec), `test/` (Minitest/pytest/unittest/Go standard).
4. **Doc tool** — YARD (Ruby), JSDoc (JS/TS), rustdoc (Rust), pydoc (Python).
5. **Language/framework** — Detect from `Gemfile`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`.

### Step 2: Requirements Analysis

Break down the feature/PRD into implementation tasks:

1. **Identify user-visible behaviors** — capabilities, endpoints, data flows.
2. **Apply first-slice heuristics**:
   - Web app / API: Start with request/integration test.
   - Service / domain logic: Start with service or unit test.
   - Background job: Start with worker test.
   - External integration: Start with client layer test.
   - Library / SDK: Start with public API test.
3. **Group related behaviors** into parent tasks with TDD quadruplets.

### Step 3: Generate Task List

Create `tasks/tasks-<feature-name>.md` with the required structure below.

### Step 4: Validation Checkpoint

1. Is task 0.0 the feature branch creation? (yes — mandatory)
2. Does every impl task use the TDD quadruplet pattern? (yes — mandatory)
3. Are public API docs, update docs, and code review tasks included? (yes — mandatory)
4. Do Guidance Used and Relevant Files sections exist? (yes — mandatory)
5. Is the output path correct? (must be `tasks/tasks-<feature-name>.md`)

## Task List Template

```markdown
# Task List: <Feature Name>

Based on: <prd or requirement source>

## Guidance Used

- <Skill or convention that guided this breakdown — e.g. tdd-process, test-planning-process, project conventions>
- <Specific decisions: why first slice chosen, why certain boundary selected>

## Relevant Files

- Source directory: `<detected source dir>/`
- Test directory: `<detected test dir>/`
- `<path/to/file.ext>` — <why it's relevant>
- `<path/to/test.ext>` — <test coverage>

## Tasks

- [ ] **0.0 Create feature branch**
  `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>`

- [ ] **1.0 <Behavior Description> (TDD Quadruplet)**
  - [ ] 1.1 Write failing test for `<behavior>`
        `<test-dir>/path/to/test.ext`
  - [ ] 1.2 Run test — verify failure
        `<test-command>` → expected failure
  - [ ] 1.3 Implement minimal code to pass
        `<source-dir>/path/to/impl.ext`
  - [ ] 1.4 Run test — verify success
        `<test-command>` → green
  - [ ] 1.5 REFACTOR: Clean up implementation

- [ ] **2.0 <Next Behavior> (TDD Quadruplet)**
  - [ ] 2.1 ... (same pattern as 1.1-1.5)

- [ ] **3.0 <Next Behavior> (TDD Quadruplet)**
  - [ ] 3.1 ...

- [ ] **N.0 Public API Documentation**
  - [ ] N.1 Add YARD/JSDoc/rustdoc/pydoc comments to all new public methods
        `<source-dir>/path/to/file.ext`

- [ ] **N+1.0 Update Existing Documentation**
  - [ ] N+1.1 Update README or relevant docs for any changed behavior

- [ ] **N+2.0 Code Review**
  - [ ] N+2.1 Self-review diff before creating PR
  - [ ] N+2.2 Run full test suite — all green
```
