  Use when reviewing a Ruby app for DDD boundaries: detect bounded contexts, language leakage,
  cross-context orchestration, and unclear ownership — use `rg` to find cross-context references
  (e.g., `rg 'Billing.*Fleet' lib/`) and leaked terms, identify misplaced domain models and
  ownership conflicts, propose the smallest credible boundary improvement before large
  reorganizations — output findings first, then open questions and recommended next skills.
  Identifies misplaced domain models, detects cross-context coupling, names ownership conflicts,
  and recommends the smallest credible boundary improvement. Covers context mapping and leakage
  detection.

# Review Domain Boundaries

## Quick Reference

| Area | What to check |
|------|---------------|
| Bounded contexts | Distinct language, rules, and ownership |
| Context leakage | One area reaching across another's concepts casually |
| Shared models | Same object name used with conflicting meanings |
| Orchestration | Use cases coordinating multiple contexts without a clear owner |
| Ownership | Who owns invariants, transitions, and side effects |

## HARD-GATE

```text
DO NOT recommend splitting code into new contexts unless the business boundary is explicit enough to name.
DO NOT treat every large module as a bounded context automatically.
ALWAYS identify the leaked language or ownership conflict before proposing structural changes.
```

## Core Process

**Core principle:** Fix context leakage before adding more patterns.

### When to Use

- **Next step:** Chain to `model-domain` when a context is clear enough to model tactically, or to `refactor-process` when boundaries need incremental extraction.

### Review Order

1. **Map entry points:** Start from controllers, jobs, services, APIs, and UI flows that expose business behavior.
2. **Name the contexts:** Group flows and rules by business capability, not by current folder names alone.
3. **Find leakage:** Look for terms, validations, workflows, or side effects crossing context boundaries.
4. **Check ownership:** Decide which context should own invariants, transitions, and external side effects.
   - For Fleet/Billing examples, Billing owns invoice generation triggers and invoice side effects; Fleet owns vehicle state and availability. Flag `Fleet::Vehicle` triggering invoice generation as leakage into Billing, not the reverse.
5. **Propose the smallest credible improvement:** Rename, extract, isolate, or wrap before attempting large reorganizations.

### Detecting Leakage

Use search tools to find cross-context references before reading code manually:

```bash
# Find references from one context into another
rg 'Billing.*Fleet|Fleet.*Billing' lib/ app/

# Find cross-namespace constant usage
rg 'Billing::[A-Z]' lib/services/fleet/ services/fleet/
rg 'Fleet::[A-Z]' lib/services/billing/ services/billing/

# Find callbacks or triggers that touch foreign concepts
rg 'after_(create|update|save).*Job|after_(create|update|save).*Mailer' lib/ app/

# Find invoice-generation triggers leaking out of Billing
rg 'invoice|Invoice|Billing' lib/ app/ services/
```

### Common Pitfalls

- Treating a shared database table as proof of a shared context — storage and domain boundaries are independent concerns.
- Splitting into new contexts before the business language is stable enough to name them clearly.
- Mistaking a large Ruby namespace for a bounded context without checking whether it has a single, coherent set of rules and an identifiable owner.

## Output Style

1. **Finding Format**: For each finding include:
   - **Severity**
   - **Contexts involved**
   - **Leaked term / ownership conflict**
   - **Why the current boundary is risky**
   - **Smallest credible improvement**
   Include the ownership direction when it matters (e.g. Billing should own invoice-generation triggers; Fleet should not trigger invoices from `Fleet::Vehicle`).
2. **Structure**: Write findings first, then list open questions and recommended next skills.
3. **Language**: Must be in English unless explicitly requested otherwise.

## Extended Resources

Load only when a concrete boundary-leakage example is needed:

- [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md) — Billing/Fleet leakage example with smallest credible fix.

## Integration

| Skill | When to chain |
|-------|---------------|
| **define-domain-language** | When the review is blocked by fuzzy or overloaded terminology |
| **model-domain** | When a context is clear and needs entities/value objects/services modeled cleanly |
| **refactor-process** | When the recommended improvement needs incremental extraction instead of a rewrite |
