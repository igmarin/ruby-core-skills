  Selects test boundaries, identifies test cases (happy path, edge case, error), picks the first

# Test Planning Process

## Quick Reference

| Dimension | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Test Boundary** | Test at the highest boundary that directly expresses the feature's business goal (e.g. integration/request vs unit) |
| **Coverage Goal** | Cover all primary paths, all input boundary values, and all expected error flows |
| **First Failing Test** | Select the single simplest assertion that will fail on the current code and prove the feature is missing |
| **Isolation** | Isolate tests from external networks, dates, and shared database states |

## HARD-GATE

```text
TEST PLANNING GATES:
1. DO NOT write test cases without defining a test plan first.
2. ALWAYS start testing at the most relevant boundary (don't write 10 unit tests for a feature that needs a request test, and vice versa).
3. The first failing test MUST be identified explicitly in the plan before writing it.
4. All test data must be synthetic; never use real production values or API payloads in test plans.
```

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Determine the Test Boundary
Identify where the behavior is observed:
- **Request / API Boundary:** Use when verifying HTTP statuses, headers, query parsing, or JSON payload structures.
- **Service / Business Boundary:** Use when validating domain invariants, complex calculations, or coordination between objects.
- **Unit Boundary:** Use when verifying low-level calculations, state changes on a single object, or formatting logic.

### Step 2: List the Test Cases
For the selected boundary, map out the test matrix:
1. **Happy Paths:** Standard expected execution flows.
2. **Boundary Values:** Zero, nil, empty strings, maximum lengths, negative values.
3. **Error Paths:** Invalid inputs, database failures, external service timeouts, auth failures.

### Step 3: Select the First Failing Test
- Choose the single simplest test case from the matrix that is expected to fail on the current code.
- This serves as the initial "Red" state to kick off the TDD loop.

### Step 4: Plan Test Isolation
- Identify any external dependencies (network APIs, system clocks, file systems).
- Plan mocks, stubs, or test doubles to isolate the tests and prevent flaky failures.

## Checkpoint Pattern

Align with the user:
1. **Test Plan Proposal:** Present the target boundary, the list of happy/edge/error cases, and specify which test will be the first failing test.
2. **Handoff:** Present the skeleton code for the first failing test before writing any implementation.

## Inline Example

### Feature: `POST /users` — create a new user account

**Selected Boundary:** Request / API (verifies HTTP status and JSON response shape)

| # | Type | Description | Expected Result | First Failing? |
|---|------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Happy path | Valid email + password | `201 Created`, body contains `id` | ✅ Yes |
| 2 | Boundary | Password at minimum length (8 chars) | `201 Created` | |
| 3 | Error | Missing email field | `422 Unprocessable Entity` | |
| 4 | Error | Duplicate email already in database | `409 Conflict` | |

**First Failing Test — skeleton (Python / pytest + requests):**

```python
def test_create_user_returns_201_with_id(client):
    payload = {"email": "alice@example.test", "password": "s3cr3t!X"}
    response = client.post("/users", json=payload)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert "id" in response.json()
```

**First Failing Test — skeleton (JavaScript / Jest + supertest):**

```js
test('POST /users returns 201 with id for valid payload', async () => {
  const res = await request(app)
    .post('/users')
    .send({ email: 'alice@example.test', password: 's3cr3t!X' });
  expect(res.status).toBe(201);
  expect(res.body).toHaveProperty('id');
});
```

Run the skeleton as-is — it should fail (Red). Proceed to `tdd-process` to make it pass.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Coverage Blindness:** Happy-path-only tests with no error/edge cases.
- **Low-Value Testing:** Hundreds of unit tests for trivial methods with zero integration coverage.
- **Shared State Leaks:** Tests that write to a shared database or file without cleanup.
