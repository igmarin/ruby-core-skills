# Skill Classification Table

> **Status:** Final — Phase 0 Deliverable
> **Date:** 2026-05-24
> **Scope:** All 85 skills across `rails-agent-skills`, `hanakai-yaku`, and `agnostic-planning-skills`
> **Target:** Post-migration state with `ruby-core-skills` as the shared foundation

---

## Executive Summary

This document maps every skill in the ecosystem to its target repository after the Phase 1–2 migration. The goal is to eliminate naming collisions, clarify ownership, and establish a clean dependency graph where `ruby-core-skills` provides shared atomic, process-discipline, and planning skills, and framework repos depend on it.

**Pre-migration totals:**
- `rails-agent-skills`: 38 skills, 9 agents
- `hanakai-yaku`: 37 skills, 10 agents
- `agnostic-planning-skills`: 10 skills, 4 agents
- `ruby-core-skills`: 0 skills, 0 agents (empty)
- **Total: 85 skills, 23 agents**

**Post-migration totals:**
- `ruby-core-skills`: 16 skills, 0 agents
- `rails-agent-skills`: 28 skills, 9 agents
- `hanakai-yaku`: 35 skills, 10 agents
- `agnostic-planning-skills`: 10 skills, 4 agents
- **Total: 89 skills, 23 agents** (+3 new process-discipline skills, +1 planning skill)

## Section 1 — Skills Moving to `ruby-core-skills`

### 1.1 Atomic Skills (extracted from `rails-agent-skills`)

These skills are framework-agnostic Ruby knowledge that should not live inside a Rails-specific repository.

| # | Skill | Current Path (rails) | Target Path (core) | Difficulty | Verification |
|---|-------|----------------------|--------------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | `write-yard-docs` | `skills/patterns/write-yard-docs/` | `skills/docs/write-yard-docs/` | Easy | No Rails references found |
| 2 | `create-service-object` | `skills/patterns/create-service-object/` | `skills/patterns/create-service-object/` | Easy | PORO `.call` pattern |
| 3 | `implement-calculator-pattern` | `skills/patterns/implement-calculator-pattern/` | `skills/patterns/implement-calculator-pattern/` | Easy | Pure Ruby strategy/factory |

| 8 | `triage-bug` | `skills/testing/triage-bug/` | `skills/testing/triage-bug/` | Medium | Generalize Rails-specific examples |
| 9 | `respond-to-review` | `skills/code-quality/respond-to-review/` | `skills/code-quality/respond-to-review/` | Easy | Framework-agnostic process |
| 10 | `skill-router` | `skills/orchestration/skill-router/` | `skills/orchestration/skill-router/` | Easy | Update routing table to core skills only |

### 1.2 Planning Skills (NEW)

| # | Skill | Target Path (core) | Purpose |
|---|-------|--------------------|---------|
| 11 | `generate-tdd-tasks` | `skills/planning/generate-tdd-tasks/` | Breaks features into TDD quadruplet task lists with auto-detected conventions, docs, and review tasks |

### 1.3 Process-Discipline Skills (NEW — written from scratch)

These encode universal process knowledge extracted from the common elements of framework-specific skills and agents.

| # | Skill | Extracted From | Target Path (core) | Purpose |
|---|-------|----------------|--------------------|---------|
| 12 | `tdd-process` | Rails `write-tests` HARD-GATE + Hanami `tdd-loop` + `CLAUDE.md` cross-cutting mandate | `skills/process/tdd-process/` | Universal Red-Green-Refactor gates and checkpoints |
| 13 | `refactor-process` | Rails `refactor-code` + Hanami `refactor-code` | `skills/process/refactor-process/` | Characterization tests first, small steps, verify-after-each |
| 14 | `review-process` | Rails `code-review` + Hanami `review-code` | `skills/process/review-process/` | Severity levels, structured findings, re-review criteria |
| 15 | `security-review-process` | Rails `security-check` + Hanami `review-security` | `skills/process/security-review-process/` | OWASP checklist, Ruby-level security concerns |
| 16 | `test-planning-process` | Rails `plan-tests` + Hanami `plan-tests` | `skills/process/test-planning-process/` | Test-selection decision framework |

## Section 2 — Skills Staying in `rails-agent-skills`

These 28 skills are Rails-specific and remain in `rails-agent-skills`. Skills that previously overlapped with core are removed and referenced via `depends_on`. The remaining skills that touch overlapping domains are updated to reference core process skills in their Integration tables.

## Section 3 — Skills Staying in `hanakai-yaku`

These 35 skills are Hanami/dry-rb/ROM-specific and remain in `hanakai-yaku`. Two skills (`refactor-code`, `plan-tests`) are removed because they are replaced by core process-discipline skills.
